\section{Project Description}
This game design document describes the details for a 
top down touch game exactly like Pong. The screen is divided in half by a vertical white bar. On the left side is the touch input space, score and paddle for P1, on the right is the same for P2. Paddles follow touch input on the half containing that paddle. Players compete by trying to get the ball out of bounds on the opposing players side.
